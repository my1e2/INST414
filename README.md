## Course Overview

This repository serves as a **portfolio-style collection** of work completed for  
**INST414: Data Science Techniques** at the **University of Maryland**.

The course focuses on applied data science skills, including data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, modeling, visualization, and communication of results. A key emphasis of INST414 is treating each assignment as a **standalone project**, mirroring real-world data science workflows.

Each assignment in this repository represents an **independent project** with its own structure, documentation, and deliverables.

---

## Course Topics

Key topics covered throughout the course include:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical reasoning
- Data visualization
- Modeling and prediction
- Evaluating analytical results
- Communicating insights clearly and effectively

## Assignments (Project-Based Work)

All assignments in INST414 are designed as **project-level analyses**, each with its own:

- Research or analytical question
- Dataset(s)
- Code and/or Jupyter notebooks
- Visualizations
- Written documentation or reports

Each assignment folder inside `Assignments/` can be explored independently and typically includes everything needed to understand and reproduce the analysis.

> Think of this repository as a **catalog** of projects rather than a single linear assignment submission.

---

## Exercises

The `Exercises/` folder contains practice notebooks used to reinforce weekly concepts, including:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory analysis
- Visualization techniques
- Applying statistical and analytical methods

These exercises support the larger project assignments and demonstrate skill development over time.

---

## Course Materials

The `Course_Materials/` directory contains reference documents used throughout the semester, such as:

- Lecture slides
- Weekly readings
- Course evaluations
- Syllabus

These materials provide context for the techniques and methods applied in the assignments.

---

## Data & Resources

The `Data/` directory contains shared datasets and visual assets used across multiple projects and exercises. These files support analysis, modeling, and visualization tasks throughout the course.

---

## Tools & Technologies

Work in this repository demonstrates applied use of:

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **matplotlib / seaborn**
- **Statistical and exploratory data analysis techniques**
