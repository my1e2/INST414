    "# Exercise 1. Clustering Actors in the Actor-Genre Matrix\n",
    "This exercise builds on prior exercises, where we have extracted a data matrix of actors and the genres in which they have starred. We will use that data to extract a set of actor clusters from the data, using k-means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download this CSV file Links to an external site. from GitHub (also available on Canvas in Exercises/data)\n",
    "Use the CSV file to create a data frame, where each row corresponds to an actor, each column represents a genre, and each cell captures how many times that row’s actor has appeared in that column’s genre\n",
    "Using this data frame as your data matrix, use the k-means package in scikit-learn sklearn.cluster.KMeans Links to an external site. to extract k=8 clusters from the data.\n",
    "Initialize the model using KMeans(n_clusters=8)\n",
    "Fit this model to the data and get cluster predictions back using the model.fit_predict()\n",
    "Print the number of actors per cluster you have found\n",
    "For each cluster, print a random sample of 5 actors in that cluster to get a sense of who is in each cluster\n",
    "One easy way to do this sampling is to use Pandas to create a data frame with the predicted cluster labels as a column and the actor IDs from your original actor x genre matrix as the index. Then you can use df.groupby(\"cluster\") to get sub-data frames for each cluster."
